# Solana
An implementation of this protocol on Ethereum, while possible, and rather unique to the ecosystem, is prohibitively expensive. The transaction costs associated with implementing the simplest indexes are significant.
‌
Thus, a blockchain with a low, if not negligible transaction cost, high transaction throughput translating to fast transaction speeds, as well as the short block time granting a high likelihood of the successful execution of a basket of transactions are all necessities for a peer to peer portfolio management marketplace to scale.
‌
Solana is not only the logical solution, it is the next generation blockchain.
‌
Solana is a layer one solution with a current capacity of 65,000 transactions per second, a block time of 400ms and transaction costs of roughly $0.00001. And Solana will scale with Moore’s law, potentially reaching 1 million transactions per second and 150ms block times.

# Asset Management Platform
Synchrony's asset management platform provides users a holistic view into Solana's protocols, so they may manage their portfolio, compare assets, backtest strategies and transact all from a single application. Users can explore the Solana ecosystem by selecting from a range of options such as performance metrics (performance, volatility, volume, liquidity, within ranges like 7d, 30d, 1year etc.), pool composers/strategy authors, asset class, and specific protocol.
The explorer is also home to both Synchrony’s and user index-pegged pools.
‌
 
 
Single-click solutions will allow users to execute a plethora of strategies, all behind the scenes, through one convenient user-first dashboard.

# Introduction
Over the past 18 months the blockchain industry has experienced exponential growth. The industry’s collective market capitalization has increased from $100 billion to $1.75 trillion (1750%). As a consequence of such meteoric growth, key issues surrounding the current implementation of blockchain technology have been placed front-and-center. Chief among these is scalability. The largest smart-contract-enabled blockchain: Ethereum, has pioneered decentralised finance and is the first stop for most users on their pilgrimage to Defi. However, rising transaction costs have created barriers to entry reminiscent of traditional finance, a new playground for the already wealthy, not only greatly limiting those who can participate but alienating those who sought blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as the great equalizers. Furthermore, slow settlement cycles and low throughput create user experiences that are vastly inferior to traditional fintech solutions which is often exacerbated by unintuitive and often complicated user interfaces. are pushing projects and users to seek better and more scalable solutions.
## 2.1 The Problems
Ethereum is slow and expensive
And the tools to access them are cumbersome
### 2.1.1 Complexity
There is literally more information being created than any one user to sift through, filter, and digest. This sentiment is clearly reflected in DeFi communities around the world on various forums like the subreddit r/defi, its top post being titled “My Brain is Melting”. This information overload not only affects new users trying to figure out what a wallet is let alone a lending protocol, but also seasoned veterans who still need to sift through the noise to find actionable signals. Determining what protocols or platforms to invest in requires a lot of research, and while mimicking twitter trends can be profitable in the short-term, long-term growth and wealth-building through strategic investment and trading requires a more nuanced and calculated approach. 
‌
### 2.1.2 Centralization
With the advent of DeFi, projects who seek to emulate traditional investment vehicles are an inevitability. Whilst claiming decentralization, a lot of these protocols converge on a centralized oracle, and typically where it matters most.
‌
In the context of asset management protocols, this could be a singular asset manager, a council of token holders, or the project team. But it all boils down to two things: there are centralized points of failure and concerns over the safety of assets.
‌
Consequently, asset management protocols share the risks of traditional asset managers such as liquidity and custodial risk, but also introduce risks unique to their implementation as DeFi protocols: no accountability, misuse of assets, conflicts of interest, and dilution of expertise and control.
 
## 2.2 The Solutions
### 2.2.1 ‌Aggregation
It is mentally taxing to have to switch between different interfaces to perform research and transactions, there is a significant mental overhead associated with context switching. So not only is an individual experiencing cognitive overload for the amount of information that overload is compounded by constant context switching. 
Furthermore, doorway effect.
To solve each of these issues with respect to defi, a user should be able to use one application to check and manage their portfolio, conduct research on potential new opportunities and execute on those opportunities via transactions. 
Keeping as much information on one screen as possible without having to navigate to another page, even within the same application eliminates the doorway effect.
Therefore great care needs to be taken in terms of UI/UX, a user should be able to do as much as possible from a dashboard, with as few ‘button presses’ as possible.
### 2.2.2 Customize Data
Even with an aggregation approach, oftentimes users are interested in specific data. Thus, a user should be able to customize what it is that they see to be relevant to them.
### 2.2.3 Indexes
Over the past 10 years, 82% of fund managers fell short of their S&P 500 benchmark, with 94% failing over 20 years.  Similarly 73% did not match up to the S&P Midcap 400, while 76% also underperformed the S&P Small Cap 600.

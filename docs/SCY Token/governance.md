# Governance
‌
SCY holders can submit proposals for changes and improvements to the Synchrony protocol.
‌
Some examples of proposals are:
‌
Implementation priority of integrations of other protocols
Utility features for the SCY token‌
Initially proposals will need to be approved by the project team & advisors. They will help guide the proposal and evaluation process for up to 36 months to allow for the community and platform to be built out and garner significant participation in governance from SCY holders.
‌
In order to propose a topic for voting, users will need to pay SCY. If the proposal receives a majority (51%) of the votes from valid voters, then the proposer will receive their entire SCY deposit back.
‌
A minimum threshold for the required number of votes must be met for each stage a proposal goes through in order for a proposal to pass.
‌
The process for voting is as follows:
‌
1 week for proposals
1 week for the voting of proposals
1 week for the implementation of proposals

# The Synchrony Token (SCY)‌
SCY is the native token of the Synchrony platform, providing an asset the holder can use for staking rewards, unlocking premium features, yield farming, and discounts. It will grow in value based on the revenue generated by the Synchrony platform. The SCY token will be pivotal in garnering user adoption and employing the gamification aspects of the application, as well as promoting the ESG prerogatives. In line with these ESG values, Synchrony will be optimized for mobile use as a key feature of its platform from the very start because globally 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked but two-thirds of them own a mobile phone with internet access.
## 7.1 Revenue & Fees
Revenue and Fees generated by the index protocol go towards the SCY token ecosystem. Fees may be payable in SCY. 
## 7.2 Staking
